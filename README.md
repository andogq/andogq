I'm a developer from Melbourne, currently working primarily with Rust and
JavaScript. I'm currently working as a Software Developer at ClearXP, and
am completing my Bachelor of Computer Science at RMIT by mid-2024.

I jump between a number of different projects, with my latest including:

- An [OpenStreetMap (OSM) renderer](https://github.com/andogq/map_renderer)
built with Rust and OpenGL.

- An [RPC layer](https://github.com/andogq/rs_ts_api) to glue TypeScript
frontends with Rust backends (think tRPC for Rust), featuring automatically
generated TypeScript types!

- A [Rust frontend framework](https://github.com/andogq/kinesis) for the browser
(_very_ experimental).

- A [PaaS for spinning up virtual servers](https://buzz.land) from Git
repositories (similar to Vercel), powered by Kubernetes.

When I'm not programming you can find me playing the violin and running!
